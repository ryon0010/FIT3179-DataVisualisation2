        <p class="subtext">
          Household incomes in Malaysia vary across states. 
          In cities like Kuala Lumpur, higher incomes reflect the opportunities of urban life, 
          Meanwhile, rural states like Kelantan tell a different story where traditional livelihoods and 
          limited resources result in lower income levels.

            This indicates that household numbers do not directly influence income levels, but rather economic activities and

        <p class="text">From the bubble chart, we observe that states with higher mean household incomes, such as Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, 
          exhibit lower spending rates. This trend may indicate that wealthier households allocate a smaller portion of their income toward immediate expenditures, 
          allowing for more savings and investments. </p> <br>
        <p class="subtext">Generally, as spending rates increase, poverty rates tend to rise; however, exceptions exist, such as Sabah, 
          where the spending rate is low, yet the poverty rate remains high. This anomaly could suggest that despite lower expenditures, 
          households in Sabah face significant economic challenges, limiting their income potential and contributing to persistent poverty.</p>
